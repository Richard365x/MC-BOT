Verified Role IDs — Source of Truth
====================================
Place your final, verified role IDs here. The bot will load from this file first if present.

Expected sections (one ID per line after the header label):

[TYPE_ROLES]            # e.g., Normal, Ice, Fighting, ... in your canonical order
<roleId for Type #1>
<roleId for Type #2>
...

[RANK_ROLES]            # E, D, C, B, A, S, Apex (one per line, in ascending order)
<roleId for E>
<roleId for D>
<roleId for C>
<roleId for B>
<roleId for A>
<roleId for S>
<roleId for Apex>

[GYMLEADER_ROLE]        # single role ID for “Gym Leader”
<roleId>

[WINNER_RANK_ROLES]     # winner roles by defeated rank (E..A,S,Apex), one per line in same rank order
<roleId for Winner-E>
<roleId for Winner-D>
<roleId for Winner-C>
<roleId for Winner-B>
<roleId for Winner-A>
<roleId for Winner-S>
<roleId for Winner-Apex>

[LOSER_ROLE]            # single role ID for “Loser” participation XP role
<roleId>

Notes
-----
• If this file is missing, the bot falls back to config.json and name-based discovery.
• You told me to “lock in the verified IDs” — this file is where they live for maximum stability.
• You can paste your already-verified file here and restart. No code changes required.
